add pause and unpause sim

util.h
shortcuts.h

add velocity to snad.
make snad fall to the side with enough velocity.
look into more performant ways to render the pixels than DrawRectangle.
walk through the sim and draw loops four(?) cells at a time because it's faster.
make the makefile support multiple .c and .h without manual work.
