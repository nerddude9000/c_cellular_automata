steam
	find an actual good way of doing this
	make steam swap places with water when rising
	need to make heat actually spread even without fire
	steam turns back into water if cold enough

make sand swap places with water
revise using remove_cell_at everywhere as this resets attributes like tempreture.

liquid nitrogen
    because why not
    (opposite of fire of course, and freezes water)
		ice doesn't move
		ice turns back into water if hot enough

look into more performant ways to render the pixels than DrawRectangle (maybe drawpixel with zoomed camera?).

walk through the sim and draw loops four(?) cells at a time because it's faster.

maybe decouple map size from window size to allow for different aspect ratios
    but for this we have to use malloc ):
    if this effects the perfomance by a bit then i won't do it, or most likely i'll make it optional

add velocity to snad and water.

zooming

revise Makefile
