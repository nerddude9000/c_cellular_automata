add velocity to snad.
make snad fall to the side with enough velocity.
    try_to_move_to ?

decouple sim fps from render fps if possible (this makes inserting smoother when moving the mouse fast)

maybe make fire spread by chance?
    ie: 1/2 to increase spread.

insert by brush
    set brush size
    insert by brush (hopefully blazingly fast)
    remove by brush

liquid nitrogen
    because why not
    (opposite of fire of course, and freezes water)

look into more performant ways to render the pixels than DrawRectangle (maybe drawpixel with zoomed camera?).
walk through the sim and draw loops four(?) cells at a time because it's faster.
make the makefile support multiple .c and .h without manual work.


maybe decouple map size from window size to allow for different aspect ratios
    but for this we have to use malloc ):
    if this effects the perfomance by a bit then i won't do it, or most likely i'll make it optional

zooming
