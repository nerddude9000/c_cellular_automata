liquid nitrogen
    because why not
    (opposite of fire of course, and freezes water)

look into more performant ways to render the pixels than DrawRectangle (maybe drawpixel with zoomed camera?).
walk through the sim and draw loops four(?) cells at a time because it's faster.
make the makefile support multiple .c and .h without manual work.


maybe decouple map size from window size to allow for different aspect ratios
    but for this we have to use malloc ):
    if this effects the perfomance by a bit then i won't do it, or most likely i'll make it optional

add velocity to snad.

zooming

maybe make fire spread by chance?
    ie: 1/2 to increase spread.
