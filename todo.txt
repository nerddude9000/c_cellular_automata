fire
    add wood cell type
    add fire cell type
    make fire spread to flamable
        (increase temp only, then check each frame for temp > x to turn into fire cell)

make snad fall to the side with enough velocity.
    try_to_move_to ?

decouple sim fps from render fps if possible (this makes inserting smoother when moving the mouse fast)

insert by brush
    set brush size
    insert by brush (hopefully blazingly fast)
    remove by brush

look into more performant ways to render the pixels than DrawRectangle.
walk through the sim and draw loops four(?) cells at a time because it's faster.
make the makefile support multiple .c and .h without manual work.
